# Skeleton

## Synopsis

Skeleton is a method of organizing symmetric keys into a hierarchical tree without dependence upon a centralized store of keys, instead only requiring access to the names of keys that are one's descendants as well as one's personal key.

## Specification

To generate a child's key, the parent will hash its key with the child's name as a saltâ€”the keys of grandchildren may be generated by generating each child until you arrive at the desired descendant.

## Distribution

Skeleton is released as a package written in [Go](https://golang.org) under the MIT License. Skeleton is currently at version 1.0.0, and will likely not undergo any changes.

## Example

```
package main
import (
	"crypto/sha512"
	"fmt"
	"yourmodule/skeleton"
)
func main() {
	hasher := func(data []byte) ([]byte, error){
		digest := sha512.Sum512_256(data)
		return digest[:], nil
	}
	parent, issue := hasher([]byte("root"))
	if issue != nil {
		panic(issue)
	}
	path := [][]byte{
		[]byte("alice"),
	}
	fmt.Println("ROOT'S KEY: ", parent)
	key, issue := skeleton.Generate(hasher, parent, path)
	if issue != nil {
		panic(issue)
	}
	fmt.Println("ALICE'S KEY: ", key)
	path = append(path, []byte("bob"))
	key, issue = skeleton.Generate(hasher, parent, path)
	if issue != nil {
		panic(issue)
	}
	fmt.Println("BOB'S KEY: ", key)
}
```
